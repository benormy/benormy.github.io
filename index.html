            <p>You might be wondering: What is the purpose of this website, and
              why should I care? This website has a very simple goal: to show
              how video games can be a very good form of art, and what elements
              make a video game so great. As an added bonus, I will also talk
              about my favorite game of all time, and how it encompasses all
              of the elements of a great game.
              <br>
              <br>
              I wish that my website shows you the wonders of video games, and
              how playing one can make you appreciate the time and effort put
              into making them.

               <h1> World </h1>
               <p> The first element that we will discuss is also the very
               first thing that you will see when you start a game. A game's
               world helps to immerse the player and get them involved in
               everything else the game has to offer. Open world games are
               specially good at creating a beautiful and diverse world to
               explore and get lost in. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the
               Wild (see image above) is a great example. Not only is the
               world huge and beautiful, but it is also chock-full of
               interesting sites to see and an endless number of missions to
               complete.

               <h1> Story </h1>
               <p> Having a beautiful world is great and all, but what is the
                 point of having one if you don't have a narrative to follow and
                 experience. That's where the story comes into play! Meeting new
                 characters, learning more about a world's past, and the reasons
                 why your character plays a key role in the story adds to the
                 gaming experience. Most retro games did not focus on the story,
                 so they only had small objectives like saving the princess or
                 saving the world from monsters. When video games started to
                 evolve, the story also became a crucial part of the industry.
                 RPG's like Final Fantasy VII nail the story aspect perfectly.
                 You keep learning about the world you are playing in and the
                 situation it's in. It almost feels like watching a great movie!

               <h1> Characters </h1>
               <p> The world has now been created and been given a narrative.
                 There is only one issue: your character will be alone and the
                 player will get bored instantly. That is why a game must be
                 home to a diverse cast of characters to talk and interact with.
                 Even the character you are playing must be interesting enough
                 for the player to relate to. The secondary characters that the
                 player meets must be well developped and have their own unique
                 personality traits. EarthBound is an amazing game from the
                 Golden Era of RPG's. Your character will make many new friend
                 who will join him on his journey to save the world.
                 Your party members all have their own backstories and
                 personality traits, which makes them all the more lovable.

               <h1> Music </h1>
               <p> Picture this: You are in a climactic battle with the final
                 boss of an action-adventure game. The fight is epic on its own,
                 but there is also something else that gives you the will to
                 keep fighting. That, of course, is the epic music you're
                 hearing. Music in video games have always been key part part
                 of the experience. Whether you're exploring the world, fighting
                 an enemy, or playing a mini-game, having the right music to fit
                 will make the gaming experience a lot more immersive. Take the
                 game Flower for example. The music is absolutely phenomenal.
                 It changes depending on the setting, and it also fits every
                 situation perfectly. Video game music is also very good to
                 listen to on its own.

      <h4> My favorite video game </h4>
        <div class="best-container">
          <img src="media/ocarina.jpg" alt="best-game">
          <p>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is a masterpiece in every
          sense of the word. Not only those it meet all the requirements
          discussed earlier, but it also set a bar for future game in the
          action-adventure genre. Originally released on the Nintendo 64 in 1998,
          Ocarina of Time quickly became a must-play for all gamers. Not only
          was it the very first Zelda title to be made in full 3D, but it was
          regarded as one of, if not the best video games of all time. There are
          many reasons why Ocarina of Time is seen a a masterpiece, and I will
          explain to you why. First of all, Ocarina of Time gave you a gigantic
          world to explore (at the time, of course). It contained many diverse
          locations like expansive fields, deep forests, burning deserts, and
          so much more.
          <br>
          <br>
          Secondly, the controls were very easy to learn, but also
          gave the player the ability to pull of some precise tricks. Thirdly,
          this game is home to a wide range of lovable and deep characters.
          Even non-important characters are filled with personality. Additionally,
          Ocarina of Time has an amazing story from start to finish. You will
          never feel like you are being dragged into the story. Instead, the game
          slowly teaches you about the game's mechanics and explains the story
          at a good pace. You will even be able to travel in time, which allows
          for some great story elements. Last but not least, the soundtrack is
          absolutely beautiful. Every track will stay embeded in your mind for
          the entirety of your playthrough. In conclusion, The Legend of Zelda:
          Ocarina of Time is an absolute joy to play, which is why it is still
          my favorite video game of all time.
